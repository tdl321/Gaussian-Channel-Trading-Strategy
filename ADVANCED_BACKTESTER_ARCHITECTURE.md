# Advanced Backtester Architecture

## Overview

The Gaussian Channel Strategy has been redesigned with a professional-grade architecture that properly separates strategy logic from execution mechanics. This separation of concerns provides institutional-quality backtesting with realistic market simulation.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Strategy Class (`GaussianChannelStrategy`)

**Purpose**: Pure signal generation and trade logic

**Responsibilities**:
- Loading and preparing market data
- Calculating Gaussian Channel indicators
- Generating entry/exit signals
- Managing pyramiding logic
- ATR-based position spacing

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Non-repainting signal generation (uses confirmed bars)
- ✅ Exact PineScript filter implementation
- ✅ Configurable parameters (poles, period, multiplier)
- ✅ Bull market SMA filter option
- ✅ Clean signal generation without execution concerns

### 2. Advanced Backtester Class (`AdvancedBacktester`)

**Purpose**: Execution mechanics and risk management

**Responsibilities**:
- Order management and execution
- Slippage calculation and application
- Commission and cost accounting
- Margin call monitoring
- Forced liquidation handling
- Position and cash management

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Realistic slippage based on order size
- ✅ Next-bar execution (prevents look-ahead bias)
- ✅ Comprehensive margin call system
- ✅ Professional risk management
- ✅ Detailed trade logging and analytics

## Key Improvements

### 1. Realistic Slippage Implementation

```python
# Slippage scales with order size
volume_factor = min(2.0, order_size / 100000)
slipped_price = apply_slippage(price, is_buy=True, volume_factor=volume_factor)
```

**Benefits**:
- Small orders have minimal slippage
- Large orders pay proportionally more
- Realistic market impact simulation

### 2. Advanced Margin Call System

```python
# Margin levels and forced liquidation
margin_level = current_equity / required_maintenance_margin
is_margin_call = margin_level < 100%
is_forced_liquidation = margin_level < (100% - liquidation_buffer)
```

**Features**:
- Real-time margin monitoring
- Configurable maintenance margin levels
- Automatic forced liquidation on extreme losses
- Detailed margin call logging

### 3. Professional Order Execution

```python
# Next-bar execution prevents look-ahead bias
# Signal generated at bar i close
# Order executed at bar i+1 open (with slippage)
execution_price = apply_slippage(next_open, is_buy=True)
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents unrealistic look-ahead bias
- Matches real-world execution timing
- Proper simulation of market orders

### 4. Comprehensive Position Sizing

```python
# Position sizing based on total equity (like PineScript)
total_equity = cash + unrealized_pnl
position_value = total_equity * position_size_pct
```

**Features**:
- Matches PineScript `strategy.percent_of_equity`
- Accounts for unrealized P&L in sizing decisions
- Supports leveraged trading with margin requirements

## Configuration Options

### Strategy Configuration

```python
strategy = GaussianChannelStrategy(
    poles=4,                    # Gaussian filter poles
    period=144,                 # Filter period
    multiplier=1.414,          # Band multiplier
    atr_spacing=0.4,           # Pyramiding ATR spacing
    max_pyramids=5,            # Maximum pyramid entries
    position_size_pct=0.65,    # % of equity per trade
    enable_sma_filter=False    # Bull market filter
)
```

### Backtester Configuration

```python
backtester = AdvancedBacktester(
    initial_capital=10000,              # Starting capital
    commission_pct=0.001,               # 0.1% commission
    slippage_ticks=1,                   # Slippage amount
    slippage_per_tick=0.0001,           # 0.01% per tick
    margin_requirement=0.2,             # 20% margin requirement
    maintenance_margin_pct=0.75,        # 75% maintenance margin
    forced_liquidation_buffer=0.05,     # 5% liquidation buffer
    max_leverage=5.0                    # Maximum leverage
)
```

## Usage Examples

```python
strategy = GaussianChannelStrategy()

results = strategy.run_strategy(
    'SPY',
    initial_capital=10000,
    commission_pct=0.001,
    slippage_ticks=1,
    margin_requirement=0.25,
    max_leverage=4.0,
    verbose=True

# Run custom backtest
backtester = strategy.run_backtest(
    data,
    initial_capital=25000,
    commission_pct=0.0005,
    slippage_ticks=2,
    verbose=True
